        "summary": "Dongkwan Kim is a freelance researcher. His research objective is to secure the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. To achieve this, he has been researching ways to systematize vulnerability analysis of IoT devices. As a case study, he investigated (1) smart home systems (e.g., wired/wireless routers, IP cameras, smart TVs), (2) mobile systems (e.g., Android applications, baseband software, wearable devices), (3) cellular infrastructures (e.g., specifications, charging policy, VoLTE, femtocells), (4) smart infrastructure (e.g., automobiles, commercial drones), and (5) blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS). To broaden his horizons, he has competed in various hacking contests globally: (1) U.S. (e.g., DEFCON, Plaid CTF), (2) South Korea (e.g., Codegate, Whitehat Contest, and HDCON), and (3) China (e.g., 0CTF). Additionally, since 2010, he has assisted KAISTâ€™s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in investigating real-time/postmortem intrusion cases. He received his BS in Computer Science (2014), MS in Electrical Engineering (2016), and PhD in Electrical Engineering (2022) all from KAIST.",
